### Background
---

I am **Cyese**, a newbie in the field of binary exploitation. Getting into the Security realm is a novel and challenging experience to me personally, and hopefully a memoriable one. 

As a *generic homosapien*, I enjoy a slow and peaceful lifestyle, while enpanding my horizon and understanding of the world around me. 

*A book's meaning is based on the viewpoints of its reader*
