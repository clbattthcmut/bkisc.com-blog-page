Congratulations to Minh Le Hong for becoming one of the 15 representatives from Asia to participate in the International Cybersecurity Challenge (ICC).

Recently, at the **Asian Cyber Security Challenge (ACSC)**, Minh Le Hong - a member of the **BKISC Information Security Club** - achieved `2nd` place in Vietnam and `13th` place in Asia. This achievement has helped him to be selected as one of 15 representatives from Asia to participate in the ICC, which will take place in the United States soon.

**The International Cybersecurity Challenge (ICC)** is an international competition that attracts outstanding talents from all continents of the world, aiming to promote knowledge and skills in cybersecurity. The competition is organized by the **European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA)** in cooperation with regional organizations, and will take place from **July 31st** to **August 4th**. The competition is organized with the goal of contributing to raising awareness about cybersecurity risks and creating opportunities for young talents to exchange and develop in the field of security in general.

Once again, the club congratulates Minh Le Hong on his outstanding achievement. We hope that he and his fellow Asian representatives will compete to their fullest and achieve many successes on the international stage!
